# What is this?
I'm following along the Creative Coding course on Domestica: https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/2729-creative-coding-making-visuals-with-javascript

To view the practice sketches you'll need to install [Node.js.](https://nodejs.org/en/) Using a console, navigate to the unit's folder and and run:

    npm i
	canvas-sketch [name of sketch] --open

You can learn more about _canvas-sketch_ on [their repository.](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch)
