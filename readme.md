# What is this?
I'm following along the Creative Coding course on Domestica: https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/2729-creative-coding-making-visuals-with-javascript

To view the practice sketches you'll need to install [Node.js.](https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. Using a console, navigate to the unit's folder and and run `npm i`.
2. Once installed you can run `canvas-sketch [name of sketch] --open` in the unit's directory to view any sketch.

ℹ️ You only need to run `npm i` once per unit. Learn more about _canvas-sketch_ on [their repository.](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch)
